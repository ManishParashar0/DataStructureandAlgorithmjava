Top 100 Data Structure and Algorithm Interview Questions for Java Programmers
Data structure and algorithms are a core part of any Programming job interview. It doesn't matter whether you are a C++ developer, a Java developer, or a Web developer working in JavaScript, Angular, React, or Query. As a computer science graduate, it's expected from a program to have strong knowledge of both basic data structures, like the array, linked list, binary tree, hash table, Stack, Queue, and advanced data structures like the binary heap, trie, self-balanced tree, circular buffer, etc.

I have taken a lot of Java interviews for both junior and senior positions in the past, and I have also been involved in interviewing C++ developers. One difference that I have clearly noticed between a C++ and a Java developer is their understanding and command of Data structure and algorithms.
